#Q1.
#Define Object Oriented Programming Language?

#Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects",
#which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.
#A feature of objects is an object's 
#procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated

#Question 3
#Differentiate between function and method?

#A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters)
#and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.
#A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object

#Question 4
#The attributes of an object are variables that hold information, or data, about the object
#A Python class can be thought of as a template that defines the attributes and behavior that objects constructed from it can exhibit.
#A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
#Object It is a basic unit of Object Oriented Programming and represents the real life entities.
